Andrew Hunt and David Thomas popularized these ideas within their book, **_The Pragmatic Programmer_**, as they first walk the reader through the type of _mindset_ and _tools_ one should implement before _writing code_. From there they delve deep into best practices for _writing code_ (testing, refactoring, clean and performant code, using Big-O to estimate algorithm runtime, weighing costs and benefits before implementing something, etc.), followed by _project management_.
